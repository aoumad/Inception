# Inception

This project aims to broaden your knowledge of system administration by using Docker. You will virtualize several Docker images, creating them in your new personal virtual machine.

## Docker Engine

### What is docker?

- Docker is an open-source platform that allows developers to create, deploy, and run applications in containers. Containers are a lightweight and portable way to package and distribute software, along with all it's dependencies, in a self-contained environment.
- Docker enables developers to build applications that can run on any platform that support Docker, making it easier to develop an deploy applications across different environments. Docker also provides tools for managing and orchestrating containers at scale, allowing developers to automate many aspects of the software development and deploment process.
- Docker also makes it easy to share and distribute applications, as container can be easily packaged and deployed to any Docker-enabled host. This makes it popular choice for deploying microservices architectures and building cloud-native applications.

### What are containers?
A container is a lightweight, standalone executable package that includes all the necessary components to run an application, such as code, libraries, system tools and settings. containers are designed to be portable, meaning that they can be run on any machine that has a container runtime installed, regardless of the underlying operating system or infrastructure.

### What is containerization?
- Containerization is the process of creating and managing containers. It involves packaging an application and it's dependencies into a container image, which can be easily distributed and deployed. Containerization isolates an application and it's dependencies from the host system, providing a consistent and reproducible environment that can be easily moved between different machines or cloud platforms.
